/** How far ahead to schedule audio (seconds) .25 default,
this is used with interval, to overlap with next,
This affects how tight the tempo control (and other real-time controls)
The larger the number, the more overlap there will be with the next interval.
How much the lookahead overlaps with the next interval’s start time is determines
how resilient your app will be across different.
In general, to be resilient to slower machines and operating systems,
it’s best to have a large overall lookahead and a reasonably short interval.
You can adjust to have shorter overlaps and longer intervals,
in order to process fewer callbacks, but at some point,
you might start hearing that a large latency causes tempo changes, etc.,
to not take effect immediately. conversely, if you lessened the lookahead too much,
you might start hearing some jittering
